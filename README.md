For my project, I decided to create a 
dynamic page structure using HTML, 
stylized with CSS to match my awesome personality.
The real magic happened with Javascript,
where I implemented logic to enhance form functionality. 
Users can now input their church testimonies through a sleek form, 
and with the Fetch API, this data is seamlessly sent to our mock API.# testimonyPage
